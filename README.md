<p align="center">
Hydrogen is a UI instance to code conversion plugin just like <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/roactify-plugin/473076">Roactify</a><br>
but is built for converting UI to <a href="https://github.com/Elttob/Fusion">Fusion</a> code instead.
</p>
<h3 align="center">How does it work?</h3>
<p align="center">
Hydrogen will convert any UI that you select into a minimal Fusion tree.<br>
You can then edit this code to your liking in order to add State and Animation to your UI.

<h2>The End Goal:</h2>
<p align="left">
The end goal of Hydrogen is to be able to identify components, remove duplicate code and allow users to animate their UI using a simple and intuative editor.
</p>
<h3>Disclaimer:</h3>
<p align="left">
This plugin is currently only a <b>PROTOTYPE</b> and the produced code may not be optimal.<br>
All promised features will be coming at a later date.<br><br>
In order to have the full benefits of using Fusion it is recommended that you write your UI from scratch rather then using Hydrogen!
