Hydrogen is a UI instance to code conversion plugin just like <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/roactify-plugin/473076">Roactify</a> but is built for converting to <a href="https://github.com/Elttob/Fusion">Fusion</a> code instead.
</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p align="center">
Hydrogen will convert any UI that you select into a minimal Fusion tree. You can then edit this code to your liking in order to add State and Animation to your UI.

Disclaimer: This plugin is currently only a prototype and the produced code may not be optimal. The end goal of Hydrogen is to be able to identify components and construct them accordingly to make the code more efficient.<br>
In order to have the full benefits of using Fusion it is recommended that you write your UI from scratch rather then using Hydrogen!
